## User Stories

```
User Story 1, Flights Index Page

As a visitor
When I visit the flights index page
I see a list of all flight numbers
And next to each flight number I see the name of the Airline of that flight
And under each flight number I see the names of all that flight's passengers
```

```
User Story 2, Remove a Passenger from a Flight

As a visitor
When I visit the flights index page
Next to each passengers name
I see a link or button to remove that passenger from that flight
When I click on that link/button
I'm returned to the flights index page
And I no longer see that passenger listed under that flight,
And I still see the passenger listed under the other flights they were assigned to
```

```
User Story 3, Airline's Passengers

As a visitor
When I visit an airline's show page
Then I see a list of passengers that have flights on that airline
And I see that this list is unique (no duplicate passengers)
And I see that this list only includes adult passengers

(Note: an adult is anyone with age greater than or equal to 18)
```

## Extensions

```
Extension, Frequent Flyers

As a visitor
When I visit an airline's show page,
Then I see that the list of adult passengers is sorted
by the number of flights each passenger has taken on the airline from most to least

(Note: you should only make 1 database query to retrieve the sorted list of passengers)
